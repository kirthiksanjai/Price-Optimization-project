# Retail Price Optimization using Machine Learning

This project aims to implement a retail price optimization algorithm using regression trees. It serves as a foundation for building a dynamic pricing model
# Introduction
Pricing a product is a crucial aspect of any business. This project focuses on optimizing prices for items sold in a cafe, based on their past sales data, using machine learning techniques.
## Project Description
The project involves calculating the price elasticity for each item and determining the optimal price. The goal is to maximize profit by leveraging the price elasticity of demand (EPD).

### Price Elasticity of Demand (EPD)
EPD measures the sensitivity of sales to price fluctuations. It gives the percentage change in quantity demanded when there is a one percent increase in price, holding everything else constant.

### Retail Price Optimization
Using sales data from a cafe, we identify optimal prices for their items based on price elasticity. This approach can be extended to any product.

## Dataset
The data is contained in three CSV files:
1. `Cafe - Sell MetaData.csv`: Details about sales.
   - Columns: Sell ID, Sell Category, Item ID, Item Name
2. `Cafe - Transaction - Store.csv`: Information about transactions and sale receipts.
   - Columns: Calendar Date, Price, Quantity, Sell ID, Sell Category
3. `Cafe - DateInfo.csv`: Date information corresponding to transactions.
   - Columns: Date, Year, Holiday, Weekend, School Break, Temperature, Outdoor

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- statsmodel
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- numpy

## Methodology

#Data Import and Initial Exploration

Process:
Import data from CSV files and database.
Load datasets into Pandas DataFrames.
Objective: Get an initial understanding of the data structure and contents.

#Data Preprocessing

Steps:
Merge datasets based on common keys (e.g., Sell ID, Date).
Handle missing values and outliers.
Convert data types if necessary (e.g., dates).
Objective: Prepare the data for analysis and modeling.

#Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization.
Steps:
Visualize sales trends over time.
Analyze relationships between price, quantity, and other features.
Identify patterns and anomalies.
Objective: Gain insights from data to inform the modeling process.

#Price Elasticity Calculation

Method:
Use regression trees to model the relationship between price and quantity sold.
Calculate price elasticity for each item.
Objective: Determine how sensitive the demand for each item is to changes in price.

#Model Implementation

Steps:
Develop a regression model using historical sales data.
Train the model and evaluate its performance using metrics like R-squared.
Objective: Create a reliable model to estimate price elasticity.

#Price Optimization

Method:
Use the calculated price elasticities to identify optimal pricing points.
Maximize profit by adjusting prices based on demand sensitivity.
Objective: Optimize prices to achieve the best balance between sales volume and profit.
